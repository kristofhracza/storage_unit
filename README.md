Have you had enough of paying for storage services? Are you afraid that your files are in the wrong hands?  
If yes, then this project is for you.

## Use cases
- One can upload their images from a remote device and download later.
- File sharing over WAN / LAN

*This by no means will be an ideal replacement for iCloud or Google Photos, but it is a simple solution to keep your files safe.*

## Setup
It can be deployed locally and on vercel.
- Run `npm ci` to install all packages
- Run `node index.js` to start up the server.

Simply select files and upload them. The program will put every file into a `zip` and will store it on **YOUR** computer *(or on the host server)*.    
The zip archives will be stored in `public/backups`.

### Vercel
To deploy the app to Vercel just comment out this:
```js
server.listen(8080, "0.0.0.0");
```
Vercel will deal with the rest.
